# Assignment 4: Nate Stuart and Franklin Goldszer

Comparing the effects of social distancing and group gatherings on the spread of COVID-19

# Overview

The main question we wanted to investigate was how events such as Mardi Gras, which consisted of large group gatherings had an effect on the spread of COVID-19 relative to places where social distancing was practiced sooner and more effectively. 

We explored this by looking at the county data for various counties provided by the New York Times COVID-19 data.

Ultimately, we found that areas where large gatherings had taken place had much faster growth of transmission after the first confirmed case.
