Overview

Due to the recent pandemic, the United States government has highly encouraged (at times forced) people to stay at home. While the stay-at-home order protected individuals from contracting COVID-19, it did not protect small businesses from losing their customers. The lack of customers meant that the businesses cannot generate revenue, which in turn meant that they couldn’t keep their workers on the payroll. The decrease of small business activity became a clear problem.

As a solution, the US Small Business Administration (SBA) proposed the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). It is a loan program designed to keep the small businesses alive by providing an incentive for them to keep their workers on the payroll. PPP also states that “SBA will forgive loans if all employees are kept on the payroll for eight weeks and the money is used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest, or utilities.”

Upon finding about PPP, small businesses filed the applications. It seemed like a perfect plan for many small businesses to survive this pandemic. However, 94 percent of small businesses were disappointed to find out that they were not given the fund. On the other hand, the remaining six percent claimed over 340 million dollars. Surprisingly, out of the 340-million-dollar fund, a large sum has ended up with small businesses located in the Midwest, notably North Dakota (ND). This brought our attention to why the Midwestern states have received more funding, both in amounts and in numbers.

Downloading the data

Our dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/data-stories/COVID-19/PPP/PPP-data.xlsx. This dataset contains all the released PPP data from the SBA, along with SBA data about the number of small businesses in each state.

Contributing to the code

Some questions that another group might want to answer would be assessing the bank-lender relations in the Midwest in order to see whether or not these are contributing to the differences in the high concentration of approved PPP loans per small business. It would also be interesting to look at the industry breakdown of different banks and how they have been handling distributing PPP loans. This would allow us to see whether or not the differences are due to just differences in banks in the Midwest, or allow us to provide further evidence for our claim that PPP loans are being prioritized in the Midwest for certain political or economic purposes.
