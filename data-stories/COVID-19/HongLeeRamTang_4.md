# Overview

During the current COVID-19 crisis, some states have been hit harder economically than others. Our goal is to investigate what possible reasons could cause some states to suffer more economic downturn than others. We noticed that a couple states in particular, most notably New York, Vermont, Hawaii, Nevada, Michigan, and West Virginia. Vermont and Hawaii were incredibly hard hit with some data points showing a decrease in economic activity as big as 90%. Since Dartmouth is so closely tied to Vermont and with some of our group members even having held jobs there, we wanted to explore what made Vermont so different. 

We looked at data including COVID-19 cases, political party of the current governor, date of state reopening to potentially explain why some states had a larger decrease in closed local businesses than others. We used plotly and Google Colab to analyze the data and create graphs.

We found New York and Michigan were most likely impacted by the large number of COVID-19 cases, while Hawaii and Nevada were impacted by decreased tourism. Our analyses, however, were not able to figure out potential reasons why Vermont suffered so much more than the other 5 New England states.

# Downloading the data

We created multiple datasets. The information includes data from multiple Asian and Hispanic ethnicities recorded in multiple cities across the U.S. English proficiency across generations is recorded as well as the population of that ethnicity in each city.

### We couldn't investigate every factor that could explain why certain states were impacted more financially than others.
- Find more datasets of possible factors to potenti`ally explain why some states were impacted more.
- Examine the differences in how small vs. large businesses were affected.
- What type of businesses were impacted more than others?
- What are more factors that could affect Vermont that we did not consider?
